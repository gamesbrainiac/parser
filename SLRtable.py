#SLRtable.py: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_LR_parser
#converts a context-free grammar definition into an action/goto table, suitable for passing to an LR parser.
#This Simple LR parser is somewhat more powerful than an ordinary LR parser. Wikipedia says,
#"[SLR is] capable of constructing reduce actions that do not occupy entire rows. Therefore, they are capable of parsing more grammars than LR(0) parsers."
#in practice, this merely requires slightly more work in step four of the `actionTable` method.
