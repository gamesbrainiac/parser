high level overview

The modules in this directory are used to make a parser from a language specification. The parser can then translate token streams into syntax trees, which can be evaluated.

primitives.py: mostly plain old data classes used by many other modules.
prettyprint.py: renders nice ASCII tables generated by the table classes.

table.py: LR table class. Generates action and goto tables for the LR parser.
SLRtable.py: same as table.py, but less prone to conflicts that make parsing impossible.

parseRules.py: converts a string representing a language spec, into a collection of primitives that represent the language spec.

LRParser.py: does the actual parsing. Taking the tables produced earlier, it can convert language strings into syntax trees.

util.py: convenience function for making it easier to construct parsers.

SimpleBinExpression: code specific to a sample language, including code that evaluates the syntax tree and produces human-readable results. Go here for a demo.
